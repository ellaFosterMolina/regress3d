<p>This vignette examines the functions <code><a href="../reference/add_3d_surface.html">add_3d_surface()</a></code>
and <code><a href="../reference/add_marginals.html">add_marginals()</a></code> for a linear regression surface that
features an interaction term. The functionality of
<code><a href="../reference/add_3d_surface.html">add_3d_surface()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/add_marginals.html">add_marginals()</a></code> is the
same as in a linear regression model without an interaction term.
However, the visuals are sufficiently different to merit a separate
description.</p>

<p>An interaction term in a linear regression can be depicted as a
curved regression surface with linear marginal effects. The marginal
effect of

is allowed to linearly change as

changes. This captures heterogenous effects in a regression, where the
effect of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_1</annotation></semantics></math>

Note that the change in the effect of

<p>The variables in this example are county level demographic and voting
measures from 2016. The data was chosen to emphasize the twist in the
regression surface and highlight changes in the marginal effects. The
explanatory variable <code>college_2cat_num</code> was chosen to be
binary to make it easier to see how the marginal effect for one value of
the binary variable is different from the marginal effect for the other
value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>prcnt_GOP16</code>: the percent of the county’s voters who
voted for Trump in 2016,</li>
<li>
<code>prcnt_unemployed_log</code>: the logged percent of the county
that was unemployed in 2016, and</li>
<li>
<code>college_2cat_num</code>: a binary measure of county college
experience. It is 0 if the county was below the county level mean value
of adult residents who had been enrolled in college at some point
regardless of whether they graduated, and 1 otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regression is weighted by <code>pop_estimate16</code>, the number
of people in a county, to capture the influence of large counties.</p>

<p>The code starts by specifying a model. We then create a
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/plot_ly.html" class="external-link">plotly::plot_ly()</a></code> object using the same variables. Next
layer on the scattercloud, 3D surface, marginals, and labels. Note that
regression notation uses
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_1</annotation></semantics></math>
and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_2</annotation></semantics></math>
to represent the explanatory variables, and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>y</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math>
for the outcome. The plotly command denotes the explanatory variables as
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math>
and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>y</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math>,
and the outcome variable is
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>z</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">z</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
<p>In this example, each call to <code><a href="../reference/add_marginals.html">add_marginals()</a></code> specifies
different constant values for each marginal effect using the arguments
<code>x1_constant_val</code> and <code>x2_constant_val</code>. This
highlights two key features of the regression surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span style="color: orange;">orange</span> marginal effects of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_1</annotation></semantics></math>
are linear for any given value of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_2</annotation></semantics></math>.
The same is true for the <span style="color: red;">red</span> marginal
effects of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_2</annotation></semantics></math>.</li>
<li>The size of the marginal effect of

is different for the two values of

<p>In a linear regression, the marginal effect of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_1</annotation></semantics></math>
is constant for changing values of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_2</annotation></semantics></math>
and vice versa. This is not true when an interaction term is added to
the model. The next image highlights this fact by adjusting the image
using the packages <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>scales</strong>, and
<strong>regress3d</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>plotly</strong> functions and arguments, we add
scatterpoints, a hovertemplate for each point, and better labels. We
adjust the colors of the scatterpoints to emphasize the low
(<strong>black</strong>) and high (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>) values of the education variable.</li>
<li>The package <strong>scales</strong> presents the numeric values and
percentages in the hovertext more clearly.</li>
<li>
<strong>regress3d</strong> lets us modify the marginal effects to
highlight their changing values. In <code><a href="../reference/add_marginals.html">add_marginals()</a></code>, we
remove the marginal effect of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_2</annotation></semantics></math>
(education) using <code>omit_x2</code> and adjust the legend text by
changing <code>x1_direction_name</code>. We also adjust the color of the
lines using <code>x1_color</code>. As before, we adjust the location of
the marginal effects using <code>x2_constant_val</code>.</li>

term. Either perform some algebra by substituting the values of 0 and 1
into the equation for predicted values, or estimate the regression on
the subset of data where education has the value of 1, and again for 0.
Note the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The estimated <strong>standard errors</strong> for unemployment in
the simple regression estimated for <code>college_2cat_num</code> == 0
are <strong>different</strong> from those created in the multiple
regression where <code>college_2cat_num</code>== 0. The same holds for
<code>college_2cat_num</code> == 1.</li>
<li>The <strong>estimated value</strong> of the effect of unemployment
in the simple regression estimated for <code>college_2cat_num</code> ==
0 is <strong>the same</strong> as the marginal effect in the multiple
regression for <code>college_2cat_num</code> == 0. The same holds for
<code>college_2cat_num</code> == 1.</li>
