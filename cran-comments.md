-   This is a new release.
-   The submitted size is 1.5 MB without any vignettes. 
The vast bulk of this size is "regression-rotating.gif", which is called in README.md
and stored in man/figures. It is 1.38 MB and demonstrates the core functionality of this package. 
I have compressed it as much as possible without losing too much definition.
